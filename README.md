# RL-EMS

Reinforcement Learning for Energy management System (EMS)- Using energyPlus API for data exchange in  simulation 
runtime, in this work I study the use of Reinforcement Learning  techniques for the Energy consumption optimization 
by using  Q learning algorithm in order to training building actuators
